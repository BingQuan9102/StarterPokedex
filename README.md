# Starter Pokédex
This is a Pokédex for starter Pokémons from generation 1 to 8! It gives a short description of the Pokémon and show different forms of them. More updates will be available as time progresses. This is a simple personal project using JavaFX and Java8 knowledge. 

This is a side project built after learning JavaFX.
